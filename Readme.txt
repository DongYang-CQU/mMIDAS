Overview
------------------
This is an extension of the Mixed Freq. Data Sampling model ([Ghysels 2004](https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/circirwor/2004s-20.htm)) to multivariate settings.
Yet, this is still working-in-progress since the proposed model cannot find visible solution to parse matricies.

Mathematical details of the model can be found in Report.pdf
